FOR LOOP USE CASES

- Iterate through all monsters in a "blast" zone and deal appropriate damage

- Shatter an object (requires looping through each individual piece and adding physics)

- Before adding an item to player inventory, need to first loop through the database and verify the item exits

- Want to turn all game objects in view RED? Need to iterate through each object using a loop and effect each object.
